# EcarGaming-Rename-Tool
EcarGaming Rename Tool is a simple program that automatically renames image and video files based on their capture date. It supports multiple formats like JPG, HEIC, PNG, MP4, and MOV. If a file lacks metadata, it is marked as "NoDate". The tool works by placing it directly in the folder containing the files.
